# Clustering Practice on Wine Data set


We practiced using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Using PCA, we are able to visualize the way in which our clusters organize based on the reduction to two dimmensions. We can determine the best number of clusters based on the performance in Sum of Squares between the cluster center or using the Silhouette score which compares a point’s fit to its current group against how poorly it would fit in the other groups. We then compared the performance of other clustering algorithms to that of our K-Means model.
