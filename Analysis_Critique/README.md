# Analysis Critique

We examine the method, report, and conclusion for decreasing hospital's excessive readmission ratio. The overall goal is to decrease the ratio of readmissions indicateing better overall treatment for patients and fewer Medicaid dollars to readmissions. We examine how the report may mislead readers and how the conclusion may in fact do more harm than good. We offer our own interpretation and analysis which offers a more concrete understanding of the data.
