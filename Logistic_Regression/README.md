# Logistic Regression
We explore the mechanism and fundamentals of discriminative classifiers, particularly logistic regression. We practice tuning hyperparameters using both k-fold cross validation and grid search. We begin to touch on the role of maximum likelihood estimation and the extent of probability in discriminative classifiers.
