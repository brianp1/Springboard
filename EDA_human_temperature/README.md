#Exploratory Data Analysis Body Temperature

A common aphorism is that the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees, yet we decided to apply statistical analyses to determine the accuracy of this statement. Using both frequentist and bootstrap methods, we are able to estimate the true mean body temperature. We end up providing evidence that the true mean body temperature is 98.2 as opposed to the 98.6.
