# Exploratory Data Analysis for Race Data

In this project, we explore the difference in interview call backs for white and black sounding names. Through various methods of frequentist statistics and bootstrap methods, we examine the differences in proportion of call backs for the two racial groups. Further analysis would be necessary to determine the extent to which race-names impacts call backs for inteviews, but the preliminary analysis shows that white sounding names do experience a higher proportion of call backs for interviews.
